## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this challenge I recap my responsive design and mobile-first workflow skills, overall I think I did a great job
for working without the figma/sketch designs, I know i probably make some mistakes regarding paddings and font-sizes.

### Continued development

I want to keep improving my responsive design skills and also include projects where I have tablets designs.
